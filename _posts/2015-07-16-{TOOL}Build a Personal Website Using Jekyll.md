I was wandering at Github last night at around eight and I saw Kahlil forked a project called [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I clicked in it out of curiosity and 12 hours later, this is what I got.

I. So what is Jekyll?

> Jekyll is an open source program, written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories.

Basically, Jekyll is a static webpage server. But it is special in two things:
- It is not 
- item
