I have watched a lot of AI theme movie/series lately and some interesting questions are raised. For example, can we really achieve a reall AI? or what is an AI? I am not sure, and that's why AI is so interesting. While it is very technical, it is also very philosophical.

In the current literature, most of the AI is weak AI depends on conditioning and a set of rules. Even in machine learning, the model is designed to handle the condition value automatically with a prefix structure. In the end of the day, AI in current stage cannot do something that it is not designed to do, in other words, they cannot develop themselves into other domain.

So people will say, why don't we just look at human's brain and see how that works? But human brain is a very complicated conditioning system, which I would think of as a chaotic system, and such system is very hard to trace, generalized and understand.

What if human's thoughts are just like program, the way we design AI right now? Can human understand the human programm itself? Similarly, can a program understand itself, what it does and how it does it -- some self aware. Can we write such function?

If not, can human really understand their cognitive process/program and transplant it to machine? 

OR

Do we really need to copy human brain? Is there other kinds of intelligence? Or do we really need the true intelligence, or we just need a intelligent machine working like a personal secretary?
