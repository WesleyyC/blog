I read [an interesting comment](http://zhi.hu/o889) today about the "notorious" overfitting problem in machine learning and the author describes an "overfitted" model as a student who try too hard to learn from the presented learning material and start to believe the some material that is not necessarily true.

I found this comment interesting not just because it's funny.
